## RAID Advantages and Disadvantages
REFER: https://www.prepressure.com/library/technology/raid


#### RAID level 0 – Striping
In a RAID 0 system data are split up into blocks that get written across all the drives in the array. By using multiple disks (at least 2) at the same time, this offers superior I/O performance. This performance can be enhanced further by using multiple controllers, ideally one controller per disk.

**Advantages of RAID 0**

- RAID 0 offers great performance, both in read and write operations. There is no overhead caused by parity controls.
- All storage capacity is used, there is no overhead.
- The technology is easy to implement.

**Disadvantages of RAID 0**

- RAID 0 is not fault-tolerant. If one drive fails, all data in the RAID 0 array are lost. It should not be used for mission-critical systems

#### RAID level 1 – Mirroring
Data are stored twice by writing them to both the data drive (or set of data drives) and a mirror drive (or set of drives). If a drive fails, the controller uses either the data drive or the mirror drive for data recovery and continuous operation. You need at least 2 drives for a RAID 1 array.

**Advantages of RAID 1**

- RAID 1 offers excellent read speed and a write-speed that is comparable to that of a single drive.
- In case a drive fails, data do not have to be rebuild, they just have to be copied to the replacement drive.
- RAID 1 is a very simple technology.
- 
**Disadvantages of RAID 1**

- The main disadvantage is that the effective storage capacity is only **half of the total drive capacity** because all data get written twice.
- Software RAID 1 solutions do not always allow a hot swap of a failed drive. That means the failed drive can only be replaced after powering down the computer it is attached to. For servers that are used simultaneously by many people, this may not be acceptable. Such systems typically use hardware controllers that do support hot swapping.

#### RAID level 5 – Striping with parity

RAID 5 is the most common secure RAID level. It requires **at least 3 drives** but can work with **up to 16**. Data blocks are striped across the drives and on one drive a parity checksum of all the block data is written. The parity data are not written to a fixed drive, they are spread across all drives, as the drawing below shows. Using the parity data, the computer can recalculate the data of one of the other data blocks, should those data no longer be available. That means a RAID 5 array can withstand a single drive failure without losing data or access to data. Although RAID 5 can be achieved in software, a hardware controller is recommended. Often extra cache memory is used on these controllers to improve the write performance.

**Advantages of RAID 5**

- Read data transactions are very fast while write data transactions are somewhat slower (due to the parity that has to be calculated).
- If a drive fails, you still have access to all data, even while the failed drive is being replaced and the storage controller rebuilds the data on the new drive.

**Disadvantages of RAID 5**

- Drive failures have an effect on throughput, although this is still acceptable.
- This is complex technology. If one of the disks in an array using 4TB disks fails and is replaced, restoring the data (the rebuild time) may take a day or longer, depending on the load on the array and the speed of the controller. **If another disk goes bad during that time, data are lost forever.**


#### RAID is no substitute for back-ups!
All RAID levels except RAID 0 offer protection from a single drive failure. A RAID 6 system even survives 2 disks dying simultaneously. For complete security, you do still need to back-up the data stored on a RAID system.

- That back-up will come in handy if all drives fail simultaneously because of a power spike.
- It is a safeguard when the storage system gets stolen.
- Back-ups can be kept off-site at a different location. This can come in handy if a natural disaster or fire destroys your workplace.
- The most important reason to back-up multiple generations of data is user error. If someone accidentally deletes some important data and this goes unnoticed for several hours, days, or weeks, a good set of back-ups ensure you can still retrieve those files.
