_`Design pattern` represent the best practices used by experienced object-oriented software developers. Design patterns are solutions to general problems that software developers faced during software development, These solutions were obtained by trial and error by numerous software developers over quite a substantial peried of time._

### Types of Design Patterns

As per the design pattern reference book **Design Patterns** - **Elements of Reusable Object-Oriented Software** , there are 23 design patterns which can be classified in three categories: Creational, Structural and Behavioral patterns. We'll also discuss another category of desgin pattern: J2EE design patterns.

|S.N.|Pattern & Description|
|---|---|
|1|<h5>Creational Patterns</h5>These design patterns provide a way to create object while hiding the creation logic, rather than instantiating objects directly use `new` operator. This gives program more flexibility in deciding which objects need to be created for a given use case.|
|2|<h5>Structural Patterns</h5>These design patterns concern class and object composition. Concept of inheritance is used to compose interfaces and define ways to compose objects to obtain new functionalities.|
|3|<h5>Hehavioral Patterns</h5>These design patterns are specifically concerned with communication between objects.|
|4|<h5>J2EE Design Patterns</h5>These design patterns are specifically concerned with the presentation tier. These patterns are identified by Sun Java Center.|
